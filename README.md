# Libft

My very first project in C at [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/). This basically sums up everything we learned so far during the Piscine (trial month).
This project covers up the basics of C programming by requiring us to implement our own version of some popular functions from C librairies.

Why reinventing the wheel? Well, simply because this is a good exercise to understand how C works (memory management, advanced string manipulation and linked list manipulation).
